word: FOCUS
definition: |
  Focusing on Cultivating Scientists.  FOCUS is designed for students interested
  in science and promoting diversity in the sciences. FOCUS supports students through
  their entry into the study of science/math at Carleton and as they continue in the
  curriculum by creating a cohort which enrolls in classes together (in so far as
  this makes sense), meets regularly in a colloquium throughout the first year, and
  has an opportunity for work-study in the sciences.
