word: Schiller
definition: |
  The odd Carleton mania for stealing and periodically displaying a plaster
  bust of the German Romantic poet seems to date from about 1957. Schiller has been
  shattered several times, glued back together at least twice, and replaced with a
  new replica on occasion, but the tradition lives on. Also the name given to funds
  loaded on your One Card.
