  The role of the [Carleton Chaplaincy][chaplain] is to help deepen the spiritual and ethical life of the campus. We provide students, faculty, and staff with opportunities to explore the integral relationship between faith and learning, connecting the work of the mind with the heart and soul. We serve people of all faiths as well as those exploring spirituality in their lives.

  The Chaplains are also a confidential resource on campus for reporting sexual misconduct.
