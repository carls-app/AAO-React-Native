  The "RAs On Duty" are responsible for walking through their assigned area of campus to ensure the safety and security of students and of the physical buildings.

  **A note from the app people**

  We've gotten several requests to list the RA-on-duty phone number, but there are actually more than one phone that the RAs pass around.

  If you could [email us](rives@stolaf.edu) with the other numbers, we'll list them in here too.

  We don't actually know which area of campus this phone number is responsible for, so let us know that too!
